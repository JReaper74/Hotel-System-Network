 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/@ReaperSec-y7l)

## Objective
Design and implement a comprehensive network infrastructure for Vic Modern Hotel, spanning three floors with multiple departments. 
The goal is to create a secure, efficient, and scalable network that supports all hotel operations and demonstrates practical application of various networking technologies.

The network should feature:
- Three interconnected routers (one per floor)
- VLAN segmentation for each department
- Wi-Fi networks on each floor
- DHCP for automatic IP assignment
- OSPF routing protocol
- Inter-VLAN communication
- SSH configuration for remote access
- Port security in the IT department
